# junction-maker
A simple directory Junction maker for Windows 7 and 8. Uses  the 'mklink' program found on Window's command prompt. The program itself simply provides a GUI wrapper for ease of use.

**Important:**
You will need to move the program to the folder that the junction needs to be created in. Otherwise when moving the junction it will be treated as a regular folder move/copy.
